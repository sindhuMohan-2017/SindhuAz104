Virtual Machine
---------------
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. 
One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  
Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. 
This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC. 

Hypervisor
----------
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). 
A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. 

Azure Virtual Machine
---------------------
This service allows you to create a VM on Azure
You don't need to manage physical servers
You can make use of on-demand pricing
You only pay based on how much you use


Creating a Basic Windows based azure VM
========================================
Create Resource --> VM --> Click on Create

Basics Tab :
  Subscription :: <<Azure subscription>>
  Resource group :: << Az Resource group>>
      Every Resource need to be part of a subscription and a Resource group. Resource group is used to logically group your resources.
  
Instance Details
  VM Name :: <<Name of VM>>
  Region :: << Region name>> --> need to select the region where the physical server are available & in which VM will be hosted.
  Availability Options :: Default --> No infrastructure redundancy required
  Security Type :: Standard (choose the default)
  Image :: <<Image>> -->  Windows server 2022 Data centerv- x64 Gen2
  Size :: Choose CPU and memory details
Administartor account --> These details can be used to log into the machine
  username
  password
  confirm passwords
  
  other feilds --> choose default
  
 Disks tab :
  OS Disk 
    OS Disk Type :: Premium SSD (locally redundant storage)
    Delete with VM :: select this one(default)
     All other fields -- mark them default value
 
 Networking tab -->used for creating virtual networking details
  Network Interface 
    Virtual Network :: --> creates vnet
    subnet ::  --> creates a subnet inside a vnet
    Public IP :: -->This allows connectivity from internet  on to your Azure VM
      All other fields -- mark them default value
 
Management , Monitoring, Advanced and Tag --> all these tabs --> use the default settings
Click on Review + create --> Azure VM will be created

Connecting to the VM
---------------------
Select the <<VM>> which we created and in overview which has all the details (Os image,vnet,size and status(running))

Below Resources are created along with the VM 
 Vnet -->which is used for hosting the machine
 VM resource itself
 Public IP Address
 Network Security Group
 Network Interface
 OS Disk 
 Network Watcher

Overview --> Connect --> RDP (RDP = Remote desktop protocal , connect via Public IP address and default port =3389) --> Download RDP File
 we
VM file gets downloaded. Click on it and connect using Username & password which we provided while creating VM

Installing Iternet information service (IIS)
---------------------------------------------
IIS --> allows you to baiscally host web services on the machine itself ; listens for HTTP requests on port 8080

Log on to VM
 Server Manager --> Add roles and features --> select next ,next and choose IIS server & click install
 
Azure portal --> <<VM>> --> Copy public IP address from Overview
 if you paste this IP in browser, it is having some issues due to NSG. To resolve this ::
  <<VM>> --> Left side Networking --> Inbound port Rules --> Add Inbound security Role
    Service = http , All other fields -- mark them default value --> Click on Add

Refresh the tab(Ip address) -->see the IIS home page
    
Costs associated with the VM
------------------------------
For a service,(VM) eventhough we are not using it,still incurs cost.so avoid to avoid those,we can either delete all the resources created as part of 
service (VM) or the resource group of the service
Otherwise we can create Budget alert to get notoifications about the cost of azure account.

Azure subscription -->Budget(left) --> Add--> Create alert for the budget cost

VM series/Types
===============
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/


Linux Based VM
===============

Same as windows based VM, but instead of windows server image, we can select ubantu server image

VM connect --> use Putty tool (Username + password)
IIS server -->  for linux based, we use nginx ; Public IP address in browser shows ngnix home page
// This command is used to update the package index

sudo apt-get update

// This command will install the nginx web server

sudo apt-get install nginx

Azure VM - Linux based SSH
--------------------------
SSH is an encrypted connection protocol
We can use SSH keys for more secure connection
This is based on public-private key pairs
The public key is stored on the VM itself.
we get the private key which is then used to autehticate onto the Linux VM

While creating VM -Linux based
 Basic tab -> Administartor account --> Authentication Type = SSH Public key
  username
  SSH public key source = Generate new key pair
  keypair name =<<providekeypairname>>
  All others tabs & fields -> mark them default --> create VM
  ** Download private Key and cretae VM resources ** --> .pem file downloaded on machine
  
  puttygen -->use this tool to extract the private key
  Load --> selet .pem file --> save private key --> .ppk file save on machine
  
  putty --> IP = public IP address of VM
  putty --> SSH(left) --> AUth --> private key(..pk) choose the file
  
  click on accept and login with user(While creating the vm) -->authenticate the user using the private key against the public key
  
  
Azure VM Disks
===============

Azure VM --> OS Disk, Data Disk

The Disks are managed by Azure, so they are known as Managed Disks (OS Disk, Data Disk)
These Managed disks are designed to be highly available - 3 Replicas of your data are manitanied
OS Disk - This has pre installed OS
Data Disk - You can store your application data here
Temporary Disk - This is not a managed disk. used for temporary stoarge of data.Here the data can be lost during a maintenance event or 
when you redeploy the VM

** There are different types of disks available based on the pricing tier
 Ultra Disks
 Premium SSD
 Standard SSD
 Standard HDD

Solid state drives (SSDs) typically use flash-based memory to store data and thus have no moving parts. They have faster read/write speeds than HDDs, 
lower access times (less latency), and a higher cost per gigabyte of storage.

Hard disk drives (HDDs) use spinning magnetic media to store data, which is accessed by a read/write head on an actuator arm (much like a record player). 
They have slower read/write speeds, higher access times, and a lower cost per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs.


** SSD are solid state Drives which are faster in nature.
All the disks are varying in performance based on 2 factors - Throughput and IOPS(Input Output Operations)

Difference between Throughput and IOPS
---------------------------------------
IOPS is a count of the read/write operations per second, but throughput is the actual measurement of read/write bits per second that are 
transferred over a network.

Premium SSD has more throughput and IOPS compared to Standard HDD, so cost of Premium SSD is also higher compared to standard HDD

Azure vm --> OS disk + Data disk (premium SSD)
App on Azure VM --> objective -->   Large videos, need higher throughput, be able to copy large data on the disks attached to VM


Azure VM --> OS Disk + Data disk (Premium SSD)
DB server hosted on VM --> read and write operations on DB --> needs IOPS


Adding Data Disk
----------------
when we create a VM with default settings only OS Disk is attached to VM and this is volmuized and partitioned as C Drive

To add additional Data disk to existing VM
<<VM>> --> Disks(left side) --> Create new Data disk --> Select disk type --> all others defaults and click ok
Data disk gets created and then got attached to VM

VM logon -> we can't see new disk
Server Manager -> Files and storgae --> new data disk(unknown ) status
  Righ click and select Initialise
  Right clikc and New volume --> Provide Drive/Disk Letter and click ok
  Able to see it in the PC Drives
  
What happens when we stop the machine?
--------------------------------------
If you restart the VM, the data on the temporary disk remain as it is
If you stop/ deallocate the VM, the data on the temporary disk also get erased. (Stop/deallocate the VM --> VM gets stopped ,release from physical server
and started from again new physical server)


Azure Key Valut service
========================
It is managed service used for storing/managing the encryption keys, certificates and secrets/passwords.
DB --> Credentails --> Azure key vault --> as storage sercret keys

Resources --> Create --> KeyVault
Basics tab ::
 Subscription :: <<sub>>
 Resource group :: <<rg>>
 
 Keyvault name :: <<unique name for vault>>
 Region :: <<Az region>>
 Pricing Tier :: Standard(default)
 
 Days to retain deleted vault details = 7
 
 All other fields--mark them default --> click on create--> Az keyvualt got created
 

Azure Disks - Server side Encryption (SSE)
===========================================
VM --> Disks
Disks are stored on storage units - Data center
Data on Disk --> either application data, sensitive data etc are stored on Azure disk on storage unit and this data is stored on the Azure Data center.
Before Data is stored on Azure data center, it can be encrypted at rest

Server side Encryption :
Here the data is automatically encrypted using 256-bit AES Encryption.
This protects the data at rest.
THis is done for managed disks - OS and Data disks.
By default, the encryption is carried out with platform managed keys (PMK).
But also you can also use your own customer managed keys, For this you need to make use of Disk encryption sets

Disk Encryption sets
--------------------
<<Az Keyvault >> --> Objects(left side) --> Keys --> Generate/Import
Options :: Generate
Keyname :: <<Uniq keyname>>
Key Type :: RSA, EC (choose default RSA)
RSA Key Size :: 2048, 3072,4096 (choose default 2048)
 all others -- default , Click on create, key got created.
 
<<VM>> --> Disks(left side)
OS disk --> already has encryption as (SSE with PMK)

To change this encryption , we need to create Disk Encryption sets
Resources --> Data Encryption sets --> Create

Subscription :: <<sub>>
Resource group :: <<rg>>
Disk Encryption Name :: <<uniq name >>
Region :: <<az region>>
Encryption Type :: Encryption at rest -with customer managed keys
Encryption Key :: select Azure key vault and key
Key valut ::<kv>>
Key :: <<key>>
version :: <<current version>>
all others -- default, click on create , resource got created

TO change the encryption for disk, it can be done only when the disk is unattached or the managing VM are deallocated.
NOTE :: Disk encyption (SSE with PMK) is changed to Customer Manged keys encryption , then there is no option to rollback/going back to SSE with PMK 
        encryption method. 
NOTE :: To associate a disk, image or a snapshot with this disk encryption set, we must grant permission to the app keyvault <<keyvault>>
a). Stop the existing VM. --> it will deallocate the VM
b).  choose <<data disk>> -->Encryption --> Key management = choose created Customer disk encryption set --> click on save

Azure Disk Encyption
---------------------
Encryption --> SSE with PMK or CMK is at azure storage level --> at data centers
We can also have encryption at the OS level (Windows=bitlocker , Linux) --> make use of Azure Disk Encryption

Create VM - WIndows based 
 same steps mention  Plus create a data disk as well
 
<<appvm>> --> Disk --> Additional settings --> Encryption settings -->
  Disks to encrypt :: choose OS DIsk and Data disk
  Key valut ::<kv>>
  Key :: <<key>>
  version :: <<current version>>
  all others -- default, click on save 


Data Disk Snapshots
--------------------
If there is data disk/Volume in a VM and want to have the same copy of that in another VM, we can use the concept of Disk snapshot
existing VM --> Disks -->Create Snapshot
 Provide all the details + click on create
 
Now create another VM and spun it up
From the disk snapshot, create Disk --> Create a disk based on snapshot of disk
<<2nd VM>> --> Disks --> Add Disk --> select newly created disk from the snapshot --> save
if you log on to 2nd VM, initalise and New volume the Data disk, and now we can see the data of VM1 Data disk as well

Azure Shared Disks
--------------------
This allows a managed disk to be attached to multiple VMs
For example if we have below resources/services:
VM1 , VM2 --> Clusterd workload storage(Sql server)
if VM1 down, from VM2 we can access sql server storage.

Enable Shared Disk --> option available in Data disk create tab--> Disks tab of VM --> while creating VM1
Similary create VM2--> Disks tab --> Data disk --> Attach an existing Data disk --> Select data disk(shared) of VM1

Log on to VM1 , VM2 and initialise, new volume Data disk in both VM's
 
** To make both VM's to recognise those are sharing a Data disk, we need to install a software so that if there are changes in VM1 data disk, they will be 
 reflecting in the VM2 data disk.

Custom Scripts Extension
-------------------------
If you want to install an application or want to configure something or run some script when the VM is first launched.
The scripts can be stored in Azure storage accounts or github account
Ensure that the scripts don't require user inputs
Don't put reboot inside of the script
Maximum allowable time for the script to run is 90 minutes
