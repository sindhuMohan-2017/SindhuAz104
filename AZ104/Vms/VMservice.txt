Virtual Machine
---------------
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. 
One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  
Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. 
This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC. 

Hypervisor
----------
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). 
A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. 

Azure Virtual Machine
---------------------
This service allows you to create a VM on Azure
You don't need to manage physical servers
You can make use of on-demand pricing
You only pay based on how much you use


Creating a Basic Windows based azure VM
========================================
Create Resource --> VM --> Click on Create

Basics Tab :
  Subscription :: <<Azure subscription>>

    Delete with VM :: select this one(default)
     All other fields -- mark them default value
 
 Networking tab -->used for creating virtual networking details
  Network Interface 
    Virtual Network :: --> creates vnet
    subnet ::  --> creates a subnet inside a vnet
    Public IP :: -->This allows connectivity from internet  on to your Azure VM
      All other fields -- mark them default value
 
Management , Monitoring, Advanced and Tag --> all these tabs --> use the default settings
Click on Review + create --> Azure VM will be created

Connecting to the VM
---------------------
Select the <<VM>> which we created and in overview which has all the details (Os image,vnet,size and status(running))

Below Resources are created along with the VM 
 Vnet -->which is used for hosting the machine
 VM resource itself
 Public IP Address
 Network Security Group
 Network Interface
 OS Disk 
 Network Watcher

Overview --> Connect --> RDP (RDP = Remote desktop protocal , connect via Public IP address and default port =3389) --> Download RDP File
 we
VM file gets downloaded. Click on it and connect using Username & password which we provided while creating VM

Installing Iternet information service (IIS)
---------------------------------------------
IIS --> allows you to baiscally host web services on the machine itself ; listens for HTTP requests on port 8080

Log on to VM
 Server Manager --> Add roles and features --> select next ,next and choose IIS server & click install
 
Azure portal --> <<VM>> --> Copy public IP address from Overview
 if you paste this IP in browser, it is having some issues due to NSG. To resolve this ::
  <<VM>> --> Left side Networking --> Inbound port Rules --> Add Inbound security Role
    Service = http , All other fields -- mark them default value --> Click on Add

Refresh the tab(Ip address) -->see the IIS home page
    
Costs associated with the VM
------------------------------
For a service,(VM) eventhough we are not using it,still incurs cost.so avoid to avoid those,we can either delete all the resources created as part of 
service (VM) or the resource group of the service
Otherwise we can create Budget alert to get notoifications about the cost of azure account.

Azure subscription -->Budget(left) --> Add--> Create alert for the budget cost

VM series/Types
===============
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/


Linux Based VM
===============

Same as windows based VM, but instead of windows server image, we can select ubantu server image

VM connect --> use Putty tool (Username + password)
IIS server -->  for linux based, we use nginx ; Public IP address in browser shows ngnix home page
// This command is used to update the package index

sudo apt-get update

// This command will install the nginx web server

sudo apt-get install nginx

Azure VM - Linux based SSH
--------------------------
SSH is an encrypted connection protocol
We can use SSH keys for more secure connection
This is based on public-private key pairs
The public key is stored on the VM itself.
we get the private key which is then used to autehticate onto the Linux VM

While creating VM -Linux based
 Basic tab -> Administartor account --> Authentication Type = SSH Public key
  username
  SSH public key source = Generate new key pair
  keypair name =<<providekeypairname>>
  All others tabs & fields -> mark them default --> create VM
  ** Download private Key and cretae VM resources ** --> .pem file downloaded on machine
  
  puttygen -->use this tool to extract the private key
  Load --> selet .pem file --> save private key --> .ppk file save on machine
  
  putty --> IP = public IP address of VM
  putty --> SSH(left) --> AUth --> private key(..pk) choose the file
  
  click on accept and login with user(While creating the vm) -->authenticate the user using the private key against the public key
  
  
Azure VM Disks
===============

Azure VM --> OS Disk, Data Disk

The Disks are managed by Azure, so they are known as Managed Disks (OS Disk, Data Disk)
These Managed disks are designed to be highly available - 3 Replicas of your data are manitanied
OS Disk - This has pre installed OS
Data Disk - You can store your application data here
Temporary Disk - This is not a managed disk. used for temporary stoarge of data.Here the data can be lost during a maintenance event or 
when you redeploy the VM

** There are different types of disks available based on the pricing tier
 Ultra Disks
 Premium SSD
 Standard SSD
 Standard HDD

Solid state drives (SSDs) typically use flash-based memory to store data and thus have no moving parts. They have faster read/write speeds than HDDs, 
lower access times (less latency), and a higher cost per gigabyte of storage.

Hard disk drives (HDDs) use spinning magnetic media to store data, which is accessed by a read/write head on an actuator arm (much like a record player). 
They have slower read/write speeds, higher access times, and a lower cost per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs.


** SSD are solid state Drives which are faster in nature.
All the disks are varying in performance based on 2 factors - Throughput and IOPS(Input Output Operations)

Difference between Throughput and IOPS
---------------------------------------
IOPS is a count of the read/write operations per second, but throughput is the actual measurement of read/write bits per second that are 
transferred over a network.

Premium SSD has more throughput and IOPS compared to Standard HDD, so cost of Premium SSD is also higher compared to standard HDD

Azure vm --> OS disk + Data disk (premium SSD)
App on Azure VM --> objective -->   Large videos, need higher throughput, be able to copy large data on the disks attached to VM


Azure VM --> OS Disk + Data disk (Premium SSD)
DB server hosted on VM --> read and write operations on DB --> needs IOPS


Adding Data Disk
----------------
when we create a VM with default settings only OS Disk is attached to VM and this is volmuized and partitioned as C Drive

To add additional Data disk to existing VM
<<VM>> --> Disks(left side) --> Create new Data disk --> Select disk type --> all others defaults and click ok
Data disk gets created and then got attached to VM

VM logon -> we can't see new disk
Server Manager -> Files and storgae --> new data disk(unknown ) status
  Righ click and select Initialise
  Right clikc and New volume --> Provide Drive/Disk Letter and click ok
  Able to see it in the PC Drives
  
What happens when we stop the machine?
--------------------------------------
If you restart the VM, the data on the temporary disk remain as it is
If you stop/ deallocate the VM, the data on the temporary disk also get erased. (Stop/deallocate the VM --> VM gets stopped ,release from physical server
and started from again new physical server)


Azure Key Valut service
========================
It is managed service used for storing/managing the encryption keys, certificates and secrets/passwords.
DB --> Credentails --> Azure key vault --> as storage sercret keys

Resources --> Create --> KeyVault
Basics tab ::
 Subscription :: <<sub>>
 Resource group :: <<rg>>
 
 Keyvault name :: <<unique name for vault>>
 Region :: <<Az region>>
 Pricing Tier :: Standard(default)
 
 Days to retain deleted vault details = 7
 
 All other fields--mark them default --> click on create--> Az keyvualt got created
 

Azure Disks - Server side Encryption (SSE)
===========================================
VM --> Disks
Disks are stored on storage units - Data center
Data on Disk --> either application data, sensitive data etc are stored on Azure disk on storage unit and this data is stored on the Azure Data center.
Before Data is stored on Azure data center, it can be encrypted at rest

Server side Encryption :
Here the data is automatically encrypted using 256-bit AES Encryption.
This protects the data at rest.
THis is done for managed disks - OS and Data disks.
By default, the encryption is carried out with platform managed keys (PMK).
But also you can also use your own customer managed keys, For this you need to make use of Disk encryption sets

Disk Encryption sets
--------------------
<<Az Keyvault >> --> Objects(left side) --> Keys --> Generate/Import
Options :: Generate
Keyname :: <<Uniq keyname>>
Key Type :: RSA, EC (choose default RSA)
RSA Key Size :: 2048, 3072,4096 (choose default 2048)
 all others -- default , Click on create, key got created.
 
<<VM>> --> Disks(left side)
OS disk --> already has encryption as (SSE with PMK)

To change this encryption , we need to create Disk Encryption sets
Resources --> Data Encryption sets --> Create

Subscription :: <<sub>>
Resource group :: <<rg>>
Disk Encryption Name :: <<uniq name >>
Region :: <<az region>>
Encryption Type :: Encryption at rest -with customer managed keys
Encryption Key :: select Azure key vault and key
Key valut ::<kv>>
Key :: <<key>>
version :: <<current version>>
all others -- default, click on create , resource got created

TO change the encryption for disk, it can be done only when the disk is unattached or the managing VM are deallocated.
NOTE :: Disk encyption (SSE with PMK) is changed to Customer Manged keys encryption , then there is no option to rollback/going back to SSE with PMK 
        encryption method. 
NOTE :: To associate a disk, image or a snapshot with this disk encryption set, we must grant permission to the app keyvault <<keyvault>>
a). Stop the existing VM. --> it will deallocate the VM
b).  choose <<data disk>> -->Encryption --> Key management = choose created Customer disk encryption set --> click on save

Azure Disk Encyption
---------------------
Encryption --> SSE with PMK or CMK is at azure storage level --> at data centers
We can also have encryption at the OS level (Windows=bitlocker , Linux) --> make use of Azure Disk Encryption

Create VM - WIndows based 
 same steps mention  Plus create a data disk as well
 
<<appvm>> --> Disk --> Additional settings --> Encryption settings -->
  Disks to encrypt :: choose OS DIsk and Data disk
  Key valut ::<kv>>
  Key :: <<key>>
  version :: <<current version>>
  all others -- default, click on save 


Data Disk Snapshots
--------------------
If there is data disk/Volume in a VM and want to have the same copy of that in another VM, we can use the concept of Disk snapshot
existing VM --> Disks -->Create Snapshot
 Provide all the details + click on create
 
Now create another VM and spun it up
From the disk snapshot, create Disk --> Create a disk based on snapshot of disk
<<2nd VM>> --> Disks --> Add Disk --> select newly created disk from the snapshot --> save
if you log on to 2nd VM, initalise and New volume the Data disk, and now we can see the data of VM1 Data disk as well

Azure Shared Disks
--------------------
This allows a managed disk to be attached to multiple VMs
For example if we have below resources/services:
VM1 , VM2 --> Clusterd workload storage(Sql server)
if VM1 down, from VM2 we can access sql server storage.

Enable Shared Disk --> option available in Data disk create tab--> Disks tab of VM --> while creating VM1
Similary create VM2--> Disks tab --> Data disk --> Attach an existing Data disk --> Select data disk(shared) of VM1

Log on to VM1 , VM2 and initialise, new volume Data disk in both VM's
 
** To make both VM's to recognise those are sharing a Data disk, we need to install a software so that if there are changes in VM1 data disk, they will be 
 reflecting in the VM2 data disk.

Custom Scripts Extension
-------------------------
If you want to install an application or want to configure something or run some script when the VM is first launched.
The scripts can be stored in Azure storage accounts or github account
Ensure that the scripts don't require user inputs
Don't put reboot inside of the script
Maximum allowable time for the script to run is 90 minutes.

Lab ::

Create Azure storage account with Defaults settings and create a conatiner, upload the IIS.ps1 file
Create windows based VM
  In Basics tab --> Also choose Http port(8080)
  Advanced tab --> Extensions --> Select an Extension to install --> Custom scripts Extension
    In that extension --> slect the script from storage account and file from there
    
  All other tabs and fields = default , Click on create VM 
  VM spun up --> IIS server got installed(through custom script), test this in browser after placing the Public IP add in browser
  
Cloud Init  
----------
used to install packages on Linux based VMs
For ex, we an insatll package scripts.yml from the cloudinit

VM Linux
 Advanced --> Custom data and cloud init -->paste the script.yml and click on create VM 
 All other tabs & fields -- default
 
Boot Diagnostics
-----------------
It is a debugging feature for Azure VMs that allows diagnosis of VM boot failures. Boot diagnostics enables a user to observe the state of their VM
as it is booting up by collecting serial log info & screenshots
-> Enabled by default when deployed a VM

While creating VM, Under Monitoring Tab we have Diagnostics --> Boot Diagnostics :: Enable with managed storage account(recommended) default option.

<<VM>> --> Help (left side) --> Boot Diagnostics

Run command
-----------
Uses the VM agent to let you run a script inside the VM. 
This can be helpful for troubleshooting & recovery and for general machine and application maintenance.
useful to run commands on VM without log in to VM
It Is there in the <<VM>> --> Help (left side) --> Run command
 Use Power shell script-- IIS server script
 
Azure Confidential Computing
-----------------------------
This is a feature that allows you to isolate sensitive data when it is being processed in the cloud.
This feature is available for your virtual machines. In Confidential computing , a part of the CPU’s hardware is reserved for the portion of 
code and data in your application. This portion is known as an enclave.
There is a special series of virtual machines which support confidential computing. This is the DCsv2-Series
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dcv2-series

These series of virtual machines are built on Intel SGX technology for hardware-based enclaves.
To actually ensure that your code or application runs inside the enclave, you will have to program it accordingly.
For this you need to use two open-source frameworks

a) Open Enclave Software Development Kit
  https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave
b)Confidential Consortium Framework
  https://github.com/Microsoft/CCF

Azure Dedicated Hosts
----------------------
This service provides physical servers to host virtual machines. The physical server is dedicate to the Azure subscription.
The benefits of Azure Dedicated Hosts is that no other virtual machines from any other customers would be placed on the physical server.
You can also control the maintenance events that are initiated on the Azure platform.
Here the users are charged per dedicated host. This is irrespective of the number of virtual machines running on the physical server
For more information on Azure Dedicated Hosts , you can visit the URL - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/dedicated-hosts

Redeploying a VM
-----------------
VM created --> hosted on some Azure maintained physical server in Data center
If VM is not booting up properly, it may be due to issue in the underlying physical server.
stop the VM and start VM --> may be VM can be run in same or differnt physical server

<<VM>> -->Help (left side) --> Redeploy + Reapply
 Redeploy --> can't connect to VM --> choose this --> redeploys the VM in another physical server/new host in Azure data center; 
              temp disk data will be lost
 Reapply --> chose this when VM is in failed state. It will rerun VM provisioning to resolve the failed state issue
 
Azure Bastion
-------------
is a fully managed Paas service.
provides RDP/SSH connectivity to Azure VMs from the Azure portal via TLS(Transport Layer Security protocol)

Why do we need it??
Earlier, we deployed VMs based on either windows or Linux, each machine got alloacted with Public IP Add which is a separate resource created along with 
VM. This allows connectivity to VM from internet.
But sometimes, we don't need public IP Add due to some security reasons or if appln hosted on VM don;t need to be exposed over internet and available with in the n/w.
But what happens if we want to install some other apps or configure something,without public IP Add then we can use custom scripts or Run command.
But if an admin want to log on to VM and perform those actions, then we need Public IP Add

Azure Bastion service - that provides connectivity onto your machines without the need o machines having public IP add.

Create a VM without Public IP add(Networking --> Public Ip = None)
Create another subnet(Bastion subnet) in VM and then click on Bastion service(left) and give VM cred
from Browser you will be logged on to VM


Availability sets
=================
Availability Sets - Review
---------------------------
When you host your virtual machines in Azure, you sometimes need to cater to the following

An unplanned event wherein the underlying infrastructure fails unexpectedly. The failures could be attributed to network failures , local disk failures or even rack failures.

Planned maintenance events , wherein Microsoft needs to make planned updates to the underlying physical environment. In such cases , a reboot might be required on your virtual machine.

You can increase the availability of your application by making use of availability sets. Each virtual machine that is assigned to the availability set is assigned a separate fault and update domain.

Fault domains are used to define the group of virtual machines that share a common source and network switch. You can have up to 3 fault domains.

Update domains are used to group virtual machines and physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. You can have up to 20 update domains.


The Availabilty set is a logical grouping of VMs. It helps to improve the entire availability of your application

Let's say if an app hosted on VM and VM --> hosted on physical server in az data center
What happens if there is a fault in the underlying physical server? or may be azure needs to apply an update on the physical server that requires
the restart of a server?
During these situations, it may cause interuptions onto Azure VM.
If an critical app hosted on vm & wants the server available all the time as possible, then we can use this Availabily sets

When you place your VM as part of an Availabilty set, it gets assigned a fault domain and Update domain
Update Domain :: Azure will apply updates to the physical infrastructure one update domain at a time
Fault Domain :: VMs in the fault domain share a common power source and a network switch

Eg : Spinning up 4 VMs that are part of infrastructure hosting 1 common appln ; with the help of Availabilty sets we can have VM's configured as below
 VM1 FD0 UD0
 VM2 FD0 UD1
 VM3 FD1 UD2
 VM4 FD1 UD3

So even if there are updates in UD or fault in FD, we will have high availability for our app hosted on these 4VMs

Is there any extra cost for usgae of Availabilty sets for VM?
No , you just need to pay for the underlying VMs

Am I supposed to create multiple VMs? or does Availability sets feature creates duplicate copies of the VM?
You have to create multiple VMs. The availabilty set is just a feature for managing availabilty of your machines

Does Availability sets replicate data across VMs?
No, you need to manage all of these aspects. Remember Availability sets is just a feature for managing availabilty of your machines

** So to delete the availability set, you can first delete the virtual machines linked to the availability set and then go ahead and delete the availability set.
** We can't assign specific fault or update domain to VM's as they are assigned as part of Availabilty set
** We need to add VM to Availabilty set at the time of VM creation only , not after the VM got created

Availabilty Zones
==================
This features help provides better availability for your application by protecting them from datacenter failures.
Each Availability zone is a unique physical location in an Azure region.
Each zone comprises of one or more data centers that has independent power, cooling, and networking
Hence the physical separation of the Availability Zones helps protect applications against data center failures
Using Availability Zones, you can be guaranteed an availability of 99.99% for your virtual machines. You need to ensure that you have 2 or more virtual machines running across multiple availability zones.

In Availabilty sets, the machines might be located in a single data center. so what happens if the data center goes down?
You can spread deployment of your multiple VMs across data centers by deploying them to Availability zones

Is there any extra cost for usgae of Availabilty Zones for VM?
No , you just need to pay for the underlying VMs

Then why not make use of Availability Zones instead of Availabilty sets?
This is beacuse there is a charge of data transfer per GB between the AVailabilty zones

Does Availability Zones replicate data across VMs?
No, you need to manage all of these aspects. 


VM Scale set
==============
- helps to create set of identical VM's by using this feature

1 app --> hosted on 1 VM
No of users - for app - increases
scale up instance size of VM so that it can have additional amout of CPU & RAM = Vertical scaling
Horizontal scaling = multiple machines hosting the appln

Automate approach for the horizonatl scaling --> VM scale set 

VM scale set is a group of VMs. Here the no of VM instances can increase or decrease based on demand.

Orchestartion mode = Uniform --> We cant' add another new VM manually to the scaleset
Orchestration mode = Flexible --> we can add new VM here and chosse the existing VM sacle set while creating the VM

Understanding VM Images
========================
Image -  This is a copy of the full VM which includes the data disks or just the OS Disk
You can create an image and place as part of an Azure compute gallery
You can then share the Azure Compute Gallery across your organization so that other users can create VMs based on the images stored in the gallery.

Image definition :: This is grouping of different image versions because you can have different versions of your images.Each image definition has information as to why the image was created and other information that is pertinent on the image itself.


Now there are two types of images that you can create something known as specialized images and another known as generalized beam images.

In terms of specialized VM images, you are the information about specific users and machine information is retained.

on your,Original machine, right, in which you first install your application and you have your data in place.You are creating an image based on this machine. That means there could be some user specific information already present on this machine because he first you log in with a user, an admin user, and then install your application.If you want all of that to be intact.Right, you can create something known as a specialized image.

Here are the new VMs that are created out of that image will have the same company name and the admin user information.

Generalized VM image :: Your information about these specific users and machine information is first removed from the primary
machine before an image is made out of that primary machine.
For this, you first have to perform the process of generalization.The original VM will be unusable, after you perform this process
