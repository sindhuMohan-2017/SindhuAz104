Azure Subscriptions
====================
When you first create your Azure account, you will get one Azure subscription and you get an Azure Active directory(AD).

The Azure subscription is used for billing purposes.

During the first 30 days of your Azure account, you get $200 worth of free credit.Any services, resources that you use where in you actually incur a 
cost, those costs will go against the $200 of free credit.

And then after that, you can convert your subscription onto something known as a " pay as you go "subscription. With this subscription, 
you just pay based on how much you use.

When you create a resource, you always need to choose an Azure subscription because it these subscription is used for billing purposes.

We can have multiple subscriptions and at any point of time, you can go ahead and cancel your subscription or you can add new subscriptions.

Azure Active Directory
======================
This is your identity provider on the Azure platform.

You can manage your users, your groups, your devices, etc, there are a lot of features when it comes onto working with Azure AD.

For any company, they want to have an identity provider security mechanisms in place.They won't define users in an identity provider that maps 
onto employees in their company and give them permissions accordingly. All of this can be done via the use of Azure Active Directory.

The steps that Azure AD provides you when you first log into Azure portal::
a) Authentication --> You're the identity provider actually verifies whether you are who you say you are.
b) Authorization  --> This is the granting of permissions to access a particular resource.
  You might have different resources defined under resource groups that are part of your Azure subscription.
  You can give permissions to your users applications, etc..
  
  
When it comes on to the license, you might be having Azure AD free licences or Azure AD Premium P1 or Azure AD Premium P2  based licenses. 
When it comes onto free licenses, you get the basic aspects of defining users, defining user groups,application objects, etc.. But as you start 
purchasing the premium based licenses, you get additional security features.

Trust Relationship between Azure AD and subscription
====================================================
Azure subscription, which is used for billing purposes.When you define your resources, they come under a resource group and it comes 
under a subscription.

And then we talked about Azure AD as your identity provider, you define your users, your groups, your applications, and then you
give access to, let's say, your users onto resources that are part of a subscription.

And with Azure AD, you get a directory in which you define your users, groups, etc..

Now there is a trust relationship in place between Azure AD and the Azure subscription.

Azure AD Default Directory --> Azure subscription1 --> resources
"        secondart  "      --> " Testing Sub. --> Resources 

** Please note that each subscription can only trust a single Azure Active directory at a time, but multiple subscriptions can cross the 
same Azure Active directory.
